For an effective feedback to occur, there are a few conditions that needs to be met:

1) The result of the feedback must be updated and saved somewhere, where it is retained
2) The feedback process must be relevant with respect to forward signalling
3) For each case the feedback must distribute itself to a small portion of the updated memory

Since 2 bits are used to display all possible feedback alternatives, there are 4 feedback combinations availible. It is natural, but not necessary, to use one of the bits to display 1 and 0 as wanted outputs for the case, and the other to indicate "doesn't matter". 

One possible signal table is:

S	1	0	DM
fA	1	0	1/0
fB	0	0	1/0

This means that if we uses Boolean back propagation, using ! as a NOT operator, and assume a standard where T is the top NAND and P the pairing NAND , with oP as output, we get:

fA = tfB + !oP
fB = tfA
